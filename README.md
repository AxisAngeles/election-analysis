## **Election Audit Summary**
As stated on the _service agreement_ the _election comission_ will get the rights to the accounting software provided for this election, which may be used for future elections with a few minor adjustments. 


This is why we remain at your dispossal to provide assistance for future and possibly more complex election processes. 
For example:
1. Future elections may gather additional data from the voters and candidates, which could be exploited with a more detailed analysis:
   - Voters by age, gender, economic status, etc.
   - Candidates results within a same Party.
   - Different possitions being voted at the same process.

2. Election process could be modified to consider a different selection criteria (i.e electors group instead of majority).
